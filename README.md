This project is a mini-application developed as part of the Front-End Developer Role task. It includes basic UI components and functionality using React, TypeScript, Redux, and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RichardNk24/react-typescript-test.git
   cd react-typescript-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```

## Components

- **RadioButtons**: A set of radio buttons allowing the user to select an option.
- **DiscountCode**: A text box for entering a discount code with basic validation and a button to generate a mock discount code.
- **NoteField**: A text area for users to enter notes.

## Assumptions

- The discount code pattern is "DISCOUNT2024".
- The generated discount codes are random alphanumeric strings of 10 characters.

## Decisions

- Used Redux for state management to handle the state of radio buttons and notes.
- Tailwind CSS was used for styling to ensure a responsive and polished UI.
