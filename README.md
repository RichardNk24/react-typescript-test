## Components

- **RadioButtons**: A set of radio buttons allowing the user to select an option.
- **DiscountCode**: A text box for entering a discount code with basic validation and a button to generate a mock discount code.
- **NoteField**: A text area for users to enter notes.

## Assumptions

- The discount code pattern is "DISCOUNT2024".
- The generated mock discount code is "NEWCODE123".

## Decisions
